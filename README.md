#### This repository helps you to understand SOLID principles,if you have a little bit of knowledge of Java and Object-Oriented Programming

Imagine you are building an e-commerce website with an online shopping cart functionality. Initially, you created a single class called ShoppingCart to handle all the operations related to the shopping cart, such as:

-    adding products to the cart,
-    removing products from the cart,
-    calculating the total cost,
-    applying discounts,
-    and processing the order.

Later, as your application became popular, you wanted to add new features, but at that time, the ShoppingCart class had become increasingly complex and difficult to maintain.
For instance, when the developers wanted to add a new payment method, they had to modify the existing ShoppingCart class, which increased the risk of introducing bugs and breaking existing functionality.

This is not only the problem that occurs in application development; there are many other problems that can arise, and here is where the SOLID principles come into play, making application development easier and more scalable.

### SOLID principles give numerous advantages such as:

-    Faster development
-    Maintainability
-    Testability
-    Flexibility
-    Extensibility
-    Reusability
-    Scalability
-    Readability
-    Robustness
-    and more
